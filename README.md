# Carbon-Bot

A bot is a piece of software that emulates a real game client to automate certain tasks. This software is a combination of pixel and socket bot, which means that it uses the pixels of the screen (+ your mouse and keyboard) to emulate actions and network packets to keep tracking the progress in the game.
And it can run multiple clients in the background.

⚠️ It should be noted that this bot is only available on Windows.

Easy Control: play, pause/resume or stop the bot.\
Connection Handler : This software knows when your connection goes out and will wait for it to come back before continuing or will automatically pause if it takes a long time before reconnecting.\
Moderator Detector : Automatically detects moderators if they are present on the server and triggers an action based on the configuration file.\
Multi accounts management: You don't have to worry about switching from one account to another, you can still use your computer while using this software; all the logic is executed in the background.\
Integrated Path & Maps builder: easily create your own custom paths & farming maps.\
Treasure Hunt: Automate the whole process of the boring treasure hunt, from finding clues to fighting the chest (for other that differ from the iop class, this might require a bit of tweaking).\
Archmonster Hunter : automatically searches and detects archmonsters if they are present on a map and triggers an alarm.\
Keyboard shortcuts.
