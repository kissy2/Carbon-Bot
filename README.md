# Carbon-Bot

A bot is a piece of software that emulates a real game client to automate certain tasks. This software is a combination of pixel and socket bot, which means that it uses the pixels of the screen (+ your mouse and keyboard) to emulate actions and network packets to keep tracking progress in the game.
And it can run multiple clients in the background.

⚠️ It should be noted that this bot is only available on Windows.
